# How to Fix Call of Pripyat Razor Crack
 
Call of Pripyat is a first-person shooter game set in the post-apocalyptic world of Chernobyl. It is the third installment in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series and features a non-linear storyline, dynamic environments, and multiple endings. However, some players may encounter problems with the game's copy protection system, which requires a valid CD key to play. If you have lost your CD key or want to play without inserting the disc, you may need to use a crack file to bypass the protection.

A crack file is a modified version of the game's executable file that allows it to run without checking for a CD key or a disc. There are different sources of crack files for Call of Pripyat, but one of the most popular ones is from Razor1911, a group of hackers who specialize in cracking games. However, some users have reported that the Razor crack file causes some issues with the game, such as crashes, freezes, or missing textures. To fix these issues, you may need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download the RAR file from [this link](https://megagames.com/fixes/stalker-call-pripyat-v1602-all-no-dvd?noradio=1). This file contains the updated crack file from Razor1911 that works with version 1.6.0.2 of the game.
2. Extract the RAR file with a program like 7zip or WinRAR. You should see a folder named Razor1911 inside.
3. Copy the Razor1911 folder into your Call of Pripyat installation directory. This is usually located at C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\STALKER Call of Pripyat. If you have installed Steam in a different location, you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
4. Launch the game from the launcher (Stalker-COP.exe) inside the Razor1911 folder. You should be able to play without any problems.

Note: Using a crack file may violate the terms of service of Steam and the game's publisher. Use it at your own risk and discretion. Also, make sure to backup your original game files before applying any modifications.
